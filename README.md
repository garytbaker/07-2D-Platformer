# 07-2D-Platformer
This is my repo for a 2 level 2d platformed
I initially used a lot of help form the HearthBest series, but branched from that significantly. 
The game has 5 controls.
the left and right arrow keys move the player respectively. 
The up arrow key jumps.
preessing the "S" key saves the game and pressing the "L" key loads the game.
Games can be loaded from anywhere, but they always load to the start of the level. 
Also, Games can be loaded the next time the game is ran. 
Watch out for the spikes, birds, and bunnies. They ar evicious killers.
Try to make it to teh robot face to proceed to the next level.
Good Luck!

I added some stuff like Parallaxing, I made some of my own art, the birds, the bunnies, the background, and the spikes for the last 2 points.
